## Quarto According to ChatGPT {background-color="#346bc8"}

:::{.incremental}

- Quarto is like a `supercharged document creator` for researchers, writers, and data enthusiasts. Imagine a `mix` of Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and a coding tool, all in one—except it’s designed for making professional reports, interactive documents, presentations, and even websites.

- Think of Quarto as a way to write text, insert images, and include tables—just like in Word—but with added `benefits`:

-   You can mix text with data visualizations (charts, graphs) seamlessly.

-   It allows you to create reports that automatically update when your data changes.

-   You can export your work into various formats: PDFs, Word docs, websites, slides, and even books.

- If you’ve heard of Markdown (a simple way to format text), Quarto makes it even better by adding features for science, business reports, and technical writing. You don’t need to be a programmer, but if you are, you can integrate code (R, Python, Julia, etc.) to generate real-time analysis and visuals.

- Think of it as the `future of smart documentation`—less hassle, more automation, and professional results.

# Documentation {background-color="orange"}

## Basics {background-color="#346bc8"}

-   Uses the latest version of `Positron`, 2025.01.0 build 159.
-   How to find out if you have the latest version?
-   Paste the following code in the Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows).

```{zsh}         
  positron --version
```

## Basics cont... {background-color="#346bc8"}

::: incremental
-   Demonstration: Let's have a sneak peak at different parts of a quarto document
-   Once the `.qmd` document is opened, click on three dots at the top right-hand side to switch between the either `visual` and `source` modes.
-   Hit `Render`. You will see output in the `Viewer` window.

## Basics cont... {background-color="#346bc8"}

::: incremental
-   For a brief start-up, copy part of the code from [basics of documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html), paste it in the current open `.qmd` and hit render.
-   Alternatively, you can copy a similar `.qmd` document to the current project, open it, then edit and render it.
-   A comprehensive step-by-step tutorial is available on Quarto website.
-   Or, you could watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvi5uXQMvu4) in your own time. It is a bit outdated, but a great start.
:::

## Add citations and reference list {background-color="#346bc8"}

Best done using the `visual editor`.

E.g., cut the tyranny of copy-and-paste with these coding tools [@perkel2022] (from Zotero).

Otherwise, you could use doi.

## Saving as pdf/docx etc {background-color="#346bc8"}

Add the following code to `yaml`.
- Be mindful of spacing -- this is one of the Positron strengths over RStudio.

```{zsh}         
format:
  pdf:
    toc: true
    number-sections: true
    colorlinks: true
```

Visit [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html) for further details.

# Presentation {background-color="orange"}

## Basic slides {background-color="#346bc8"}

-   We used the good ol' `.qmd`.
-   Add `revealjs` in the format. Or, to make it more elaborate:

``` {zsh}        
format: 
  revealjs:
    theme: simple
    highlight-style: github
    slide-number: c/t
```

Other formats include **pptx** and **beamer**.

-   Further info: <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>

-   Demo: let's use the current slides as an example :)

## Sharing slides {background-color="#346bc8"}

1.  Save as pdf: This option only works with `Google Chrome` as explained [here](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf). Or, see below. ![](figs/pdf.png)

## Sharing slides {background-color="#346bc8"}

2.  Provide the url from the blog/site.

Do you see any advantages with this?

3. Or, share `html`

```{zsh}
    embed-resources: false
```


# Version control, Remote repositories, and Blogging {background-color="orange"}

## Git {background-color="#346bc8"}

## Blogging {background-color="#346bc8"}

Now that we know basics of documentation, version control and remote repos, blogging is extremely easy with Quarto.

Blogging with Quarto can be done with the use of Git and `GitHub Pages`, or we can also use `PositCloud` instead of GitHub Pages.

Recently, Posit provided a [series of new videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9HYL-VRX0oSFkdF4fJeY63eGDvgofcbn) on Quarto that I am yet to watch. There is a small [watchlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7r24gTEkEY) on blogging too. From a brief look, it looks like these are even easier and more accessible.

## Needed for blogging {background-color="#346bc8" .smaller}

Important steps for using remote repo are:

1.  Git *This may or may not work.* The guide is available in the shared folder.
2.  GitHub account
3.  Connecting the local system with remote repo
4.  Creating a repository on GitHub
5.  Connecting the remote repo with the local one

These steps are important whether or not we are blogging. For blogging, we also need a publisher domain - which could be GitHub Pages or PositCloud.

## A few examples {background-color="#346bc8"}

- Provided code
- T/NT paper
- Repos + website


## Revisit the problems {background-color="magenta"}

:::{.incremental}
- Keep your data files and write up files integrated.
- Automation
- Efficiency
- Avoid re-doing
- Register data analytic steps
- Hide/show `R` code when appropriate.
- Don't need to keep many versions of the same document (version control)
- A free application which perhaps makes MS Word and SPSS/Jamovi/Statistica etc. redundant
- Better formatting options
- Trendy - with a large and growing develope community
- Publishable, executable, and shareable code.
- Move ready-made `.qmd` files to a journal template rather than re-formatting the whole manuscript.
- The pdf version is generally appropriate for `PsyArXiv`.
- Store files online
