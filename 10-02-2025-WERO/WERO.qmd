# Background

## Overview {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}

1. **New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS)**:
   - A nationally representative panel study, initiated in 2009, currently in year 16.
   - Sample frame is drawn randomly from the NZ Electoral Roll.
   - Postal questionnaire (coverage; retention \~ 70-80%).
   - Large multidisciplinary research team (\>80).
   - Focus on personality, social attitudes, values, religion, employment, prejudice $\dots$

   - Tracks nearly 1% of New Zealand’s adult population annually, with 76,409 participants to date.

   - Limitations with Muslim sample [@afzali2024]

2. **Muslim Diversity Study (MDS)**:
   - A longitudinal booster study within the NZAVS, launched in 2023.
   - Established in partnership and co-desiging with the Muslim community to improve representation of Muslims in the NZAVS.
   - Increased Muslim sample from less than 0.1% to nearly 1% of New Zealand’s Muslim population (658 participants) [@afzali2024].


3. **Purpose of the MDS**:
   - Document Muslim *resilience*, *flourishing*, *meaning-making*, *wellbeing*, etc. over the lifespan
   - Explore challenges to flourishing and examine how Muslims overcome adversity.
   - Address gaps in research on how adversity shapes the experiences of Muslims in New Zealand.

4. **Broader Contribution**:
   - Amplifies Muslim voices within NZAVS’s historical record.
   - Aims to enrich understanding of beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours of New Zealanders for future generations.
   - Shares findings with diff stakeholders e.g., the government, community organisations, rights advocates $\dots$

# Current Findings

## Model

:::{.incremental}

- Self-perception
- Psychological wellbeing
- Overall wellbeing
- Religiosity
- Report models that control for demographics unlikely to be influenced by religious identification (age, place of birth, ethnicity, and gender).
- Focus on documenting associations between religious affiliation and wellbeing, without inferring causality.

## Self-Perception Measures

:::{.incremental}

- Age: *I feel that I am often discriminated against because of my age.*
- Gender: *I feel that I am often discriminated against because of my gender.*
- Ethnic: *I feel that I am often discriminated against because of my ethnicity.*
- Religious: *I feel that I am often discriminated against because of my religious/spiritual beliefs.*

## Self-Perception

![](plots/plot_descrim.png)

## Findings ... {.smaller}

- Muslims face distinctive challenges, with religious discrimination as the most pronounced disparity, consistent with prior research on low societal acceptance of Muslims in New Zealand.


## Psychological Wellbeing

- Anxiety: Kessler
- Depression: Kessler
- Fatigue: *During the last 30 days, how often did … you feel exhausted?*
- Rumination: *During the last 30 days, how often did…you have negative thoughts that repeated over and over? (Nolen-hoeksema & Morrow 1993).*

- Muslims exhibit robust psychological well-being, particularly in anxiety, fatigue, and rumination.

## Life-Reflective Wellbeing Measures

::: {.incremental}

- Gratitude: *I have much in my life to be thankful for. When I look at the world, I don’t see much to be grateful for (reversed). I am grateful to a wide variety of people.* (McCullough et al., 2002)

- Life Satisfaction: *I am satisfied with my life. In most ways my life is close to ideal.* (Diener et al. 1985).

- Meaning (Purpose): *My life has a clear sense of purpose.* (Steger et al. 2006)

- Meaning (Sense): *I have a good sense of what makes my life meaningful.* (Steger et al. 2006)

- Findings underscore consistently elevated life-focused wellbeing among Muslims, with gratitude, life satisfaction, and meaning playing key roles.

## Person-Focussed Wellbeing Measures

::: {.incremental}

- Self Esteem: *On the whole am satisfied with myself. I take a positive attitude toward myself. I am inclined to feel that I am a failure (reversed).*
- Forgivingness: *Sometimes I can’t sleep because of thinking about past wrongs I have suffered. I can usually forgive and forget when someone does me wrong. I find myself regularly thinking about past times that I have been wronged.*
- Perfectionisn: *Doing my best never seems to be enough. My performance rarely measures up to my standards. I am hardly ever satisfied with my performance.* (Rice et al., 2014)

## Person-Focussed Wellbeing

- Muslims face distinctive challenges, with religious discrimination as the most pronounced disparity, consistent with prior research on low societal acceptance of Muslims in New Zealand.
- Findings suggest that Muslims exhibit robust psychological well-being, particularly in anxiety, fatigue, and rumination
- Findings underscore consistently elevated life-focused well-being among Muslims, with gratitude, life satisfaction, and meaning playing key roles.

:::

- Muslims report high self esteem despite adversity and religious discrimination.

## The Importance/Strength of Findings {.smaller}

:::{.incremental}

- Muslim report relatively high religious discrimination.
- Yet, their psychology wellbeing is comparable with other groups.
- Their life-focussed wellbeing is elevated.
- Their person-focusssed wellbeing is great.
- Large sample size.
- These models adjust for demographic measures (age, place of birth, ethnicity, and gender).

:::

## Religious Belief


- Do you believe in a God?

- Do you believe in some form of spirit or life force?

##

![](plots/plot_belief.png)

## Religious Identification

- How important is your religion to how you see yourself?
- I identify as a spiritual person.


##

![](plots/plot_religious_id.png)

## Religious Practices

- How many times did you attend a church or place of worship in the last month?

- How many times did you pray in the last week?

- How many times did you read religious scripture in the last week?

## 

![](plots/plot_religious_practice.png)


## Conclusions

:::{.incremental}
- Findings suggest that religious identity, community, and practices may enhance self-esteem while buffering against prejudice. 

- Future research should investigate these questions longitudinally.

:::

## A Final Thought

:::{.incremental}

Building on these findings, I want to argue that `Islamophobia` should be categorised specifically as `religious discrimination` rather than `race-based discrimination`. 

This distinction would bring greater nuance to how we understand and address the structure of discrimination.
