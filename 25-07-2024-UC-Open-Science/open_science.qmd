# Scientific Publishing

## The Evolution of Scientific Publishing

::: incremental
-   Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (1655) by Henry
    Oldenburg. (<https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsta/about>)
-   Also, Journal des Sçavans (1665)
    (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_des_sçavans>).
-   Nature (1869) by Sir Joseph Norman Lockyer
    (<https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/about>) (*IF = 54.4*).
-   19th Century: Growth of specialized journals.
-   20th Century: Rise of electronic publishing and faster dissemination
    and broader access through digital means
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Paywalls and Access to Scientific Articles

::: incremental
-   Initially, published by scientific societies or university presses
-   Funded through memberships, subscriptions, or institutional support
-   Commercial publishing: subscription fees and profit motivation
-   Open Access journals
-   Hybrid journals
-   Some examples: [Wiley](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com),
    [Routldeg/Taylor and Francis](https://www.taylorfrancis.com),
    [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/products/sciencedirect/journals),
    [Nature](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal-impact),
    [APA](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals).

## Questionable Research Practices (QRPs)

::: incremental
-   False positive psychology [@simmons2011]
-   Researchers degrees of freedom
-   Data manipulation, selective reporting, lack of transparency (e.g.,
    in terms of excluding outliers)
-   Choosing the DV, choosing sample size arbitrarily, random
    covariates, reporting a subset of findings only

## *p*-Hacking

::: incremental
-   Manipulation of data analysis or reporting practices to find
    statistically significant results
-   Inflates the likelihood of finding false positives, undermines the
    reliability of research
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Possible reasons for *p*-Hacking

::: incremental
-   **Researcher’s Intent:** Desire to publish significant findings.
-   **Ambiguity in Data Analysis:** Lack of clear analytical plans.
-   **Lack of Pre-planning:** Not specifying methods before data
    collection.
:::

## Changing the false positive rate

![](~/Documents/Figures/p-Hacking-table.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## HARKing

::: incremental
-   Hypothesizing After the Results are Known
-   Presenting a *post hoc* hypothesis as if it were an *a priori*
    hypothesis
-   Dataset: significant correlation between X and Y, *p* = .02
-   What are the chances of finding this correlation in this dataset?
-   HARKing ruins the meaning of *p*-values
:::

## Why would one engage in QRP's?

![](~/Documents/Figures/publish-perish-comic.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## 

::: incremental
-   Pressure to Publish ("Publish or Perish")
-   Career advancement
-   Research funding
-   Some examples: *p*-Hacking, HARKing, selective reporting, data
    fabrication/falsification, inadequate reporting of methods and
    procedures, publication bias, over-interpretation of results

# Open Science

## 

::: incremental
-   Involves practices that make research processes and outputs more
    transparent and accessible
-   Enhances reproducibility, accountability, and collaboration in
    research
-   Premise: Science works best in sunlight
-   Science paid for by public, given to journals, sold back to public
-   Publication model relies on universities paying for access to
    journals
-   Science should be publicly available
-   Preprints (PsyArXiv: <https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv>)
-   Open access/hybrid journals
:::

## Open Materials

-   Journal articles have word limits, often lack key details
-   Unpublished studies left in file drawer – generally, published on
    OSF, or linked it from PsyArXiv to OSF
-   See @morling2020a

## Open Data

-   Allows researchers to check for mistakes, fraud
-   Be careful with confidentiality and privacy
-   Enhances potential for meta-analysis, re-analysis

## Preregistration

-   Design, analyses pre-planned
-   Preregistration = writing up your hypotheses, conditions, data
    analytic plan, etc.
-   Prevents *p*-hacking, HARKing
-   Does not prevent fraud

## Registered Reports

-   Peer-review *before* data collection: e.g.,
    <https://osf.io/nru4x/?view_only=bc189174a1cf4ca8b1dc83cf7967cd9e>

## 

Open Access (OA) refers to making research outputs freely available
online, without subscription or payment barriers.

The Open Access movement advocates for free and unrestricted access to
research publications. Many researchers and institutions support this
model, arguing that publicly funded research should be freely available
to everyone. There are various Open Access models, including Gold Open
Access (where authors or institutions pay publication fees) and Green
Open Access (where authors deposit preprints or postprints in
repositories).

cOAlition S: This is an initiative launched in 2018 that requires
research funded by participating organizations to be published in
compliant open access journals or platforms.

## Open Science Manifesto

-   Openness adds credibility
-   Openness means mistakes are visible (doesn’t mean mistakes don’t
    happen!)

# Preregistration

## How to Preregister?

-   Various platforms: <https://aspredicted.org>, <https://osf.io>
-   Information to provide: Hypothesis, Dependent variable, Conditions,
    Analyses, Outliers and Exclusions, Sample size, Other.
-   Example: <https://osf.io/7ghcz>

## Details

-   **Hypothesis.** What's the main question being asked, or hypothesis
    being tested in this study?
-   **Dependent variable.** Describe the key dependent variable(s)
    specifying how they will be measured.
-   **Conditions.** How many and which conditions will participants be
    assigned to?
-   **Analyses.** Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to
    examine the main question/hypothesis.
-   **Outliers and Exclusions.** Describe exactly how outliers will be
    defined and handled, and your precise rule(s) for excluding
    observations.
-   **Sample Size.** How many observations will be collected or what
    will determine sample size?
-   **Other.** Anything else you would like to pre-register? (e.g.,
    secondary analyses, variables collected for exploratory purposes,
    unusual analyses planned?)

## Preregistration FAQ's

-   **After running preregistered analyses, discover something
    surprising!**
-   *Totally fine to run exploratory follow-up analyses*
-   *Label them as exploratory in the paper*
-   **Learn better analysis technique after study is preregistered**
-   *Disclose in paper*
-   *Usually, should also run planned analyses*
-   *Reporting in supplemental materials okay*
-   *If you don’t run, need to explain why*
-   **Data already collected**
-   *OK to preregister late, but…*
-   *Ideal to preregister before collection*
-   *Important to preregister before looking at data*
-   *Vital to preregister before running focal test*

## Preregistration FAQ's

-   **Data collection doesn’t go as planned**
-   *Power analysis indicates n = 200 N are needed to detect our effect
    with 80% power. We will collect n = 200.”*
-   *n = 87 participants failed inclusion criteria*
-   *What do you do?*
-   *Make reasonable decision, and disclose*
-   **Vague analyses**
-   *\`\`ANOVA will test the difference between conditions”*
-   *Hypothesized direction of differences?*
-   *Post hoc comparisons? Planned comparisons? Which type?*
-   *Disclose decision-process, be more specific in future*
-   **Vague hypothesis**
-   *\`\`We predict that people will report lower levels of free will in
    A and B conditions than in C condition, and furthermore that free
    will will be lower in the A condition than in B condition.”*
-   *What does this predict? A \> B \> C: (A & B) \> C, A \> B*

## A small diversion

::: incremental
-   Predatory journals: A type of publication that exploits the
    open-access model by charging authors significant fees without
    providing the standard editorial and publishing services associated
    with legitimate academic journals. See: Beall's list
    <https://beallslist.net>
-   Cloned journals: A fraudulent imitation of a legitimate academic
    journal. These fake journals mimic the name, website, and other
    details of established and reputable journals to deceive researchers
    into submitting their work and paying publication fees.
