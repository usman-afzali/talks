## Muslim Diversity Study (MDS)
:::{.incremental}
- Booster for NZAVS to address under-representation
- Recruit 650 Muslims across six New Zealand cities
- Knowledge mobilization
- Sharing with diff stakeholders e.g., the government, community orgs, rights advocates
- Wave 1 ended
- 30 staff (part-time fixed-term)
:::

## MDS Scope
:::{.incremental}
- Do individuals with the strongest ties to their religious communities (e.g., through service attendance and prayer) experience less prejudice compared to others?

- Do followers of certain religions face more significant challenges in employment and health compared to members of other religious groups?

- Are wellbeing, sense of meaning in life, and psychological distress similar across religious groups due to the buffering effects of religious community-making?

- Provides understanding of psychology of religion, human flourishing, and wellbeing across different religious denominations
