-   Time constraints and having to be efficient.
-   Having to redo a whole document only to change formatting for various purposes.
-   MS Word is not necessarily the best application for writing up.
-   The need to remember data analysis/stats decisions made along the way.

# Documentation {background-color="orange"}

## Basics {background-color="#346bc8"}

::: incremental
-   Use the latest version of `RStudio`, at least `Version: 2022.12.0+353` or later on your computer.
-   Within `RStudio`, click on `new file` drop down menu and open a new `Quarto Document`, and name it. ![RStudio Interface](/posts/r-interface.png)

## Basics cont... {background-color="#346bc8"}

-   Let's have a sneak peak at different parts of a quarto document [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html).
-   Once the `.qmd` document is opened, use either the `source` tab or `visual` tab to start documenting or writing code. Then hit `Render`. You will see output in the `Viewer` menu. See next slide.

-   Let's try some hands on start-up.
-   Demo
-   Alternatively, you can copy a similar `.qmd` document to the current project, open it, then edit and render it.
-   A comprehensive step-by-step tutorial is available on Quarto [website](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).
-   Or, you could watch this YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvi5uXQMvu4) in your own time. It is a bit outdated, but a great start.

## Add citations and reference list {background-color="#346bc8"}

Best done using the `visual editor`.

E.g., Quarto can be used to create executable manuscripts in RStudio, Python, or VS Code [@perkel2022].

## Saving as pdf {background-color="#346bc8"}

Add the following code to `yaml`.

```         
format:
  pdf:
    toc: true
    number-sections: true
    colorlinks: true
```

Visit [quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html) for further details.


## Saving as docx/Word {background-color="#346bc8"}

Add the following code to `yaml`.

```
format:
  docx:
    toc: true
    number-sections: true
    highlight-style: github
```

## Blogging {background-color="#346bc8"}

Now that we know basics of documentation, version control and remote repos (I know, we are yet to demonstrate this), blogging is extremely easy with Quarto. There are two ways:

1.  We can add a `_quarto.yml` file in to our local repo, render it, and it would starting shaping like a blog. This is the more complicated way.
2.  We can use an available blog template, create a new local repo and take it from there.

Here is a [quick guide](https://youtu.be/YoKjBcuUP0s).

## Blogging contd... {background-color="#346bc8"}

Blogging with Quarto can be done with the use of Git and `GitHub Pages`, or we can also use `PositCloud` instead of GitHub Pages.

As we can see [here](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#render-to-docs), a must do step during blogging with GitHub Pages is rendering output directory to `docs` in `_quarto.yml`.

```         
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```

## Demo {background-color="#346bc8"}

Important steps for using remote repo are:

1.  Installing Git
2.  Creating a GitHub account
3.  Connecting the local system with remote repo
4.  Creating a repository on GitHub
5.  Connecting the remote repo with the local one

These steps are important whether or not we are blogging. For blogging, then of course we need a publisher domain - which could be GitHub Pages or PositCloud.

# Quarto Templates {background-color="orange"}

## An example {background-color="#346bc8"}

## Advantages of documentation with Quarto {background-color="#346bc8"}

:::incremental

-   Keep your data files and write up files integrated.
-   Create re-usable workflow -- becomes much easier once we are familiar.
-   Use version control to see the previous versions.
-   Hide/show `R` code when appropriate.
-   Move ready-made `.qmd` files to a journal template rather than re-formatting the whole manuscript.
-   The pdf version is generally appropriate for `PsyArXiv`.

# Presentation {background-color="orange"}

## Basic slides {background-color="#346bc8"}

-   We used the good ol' `.qmd`.
-   Add `revealjs` in the format. Or, to make it more elaborate:

```         
format: 
  revealjs:
    theme: simple
    highlight-style: github
    slide-number: c/t
```

-   Further info: <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>

-   Demo: let's use the current slides as an example :)

## Sharing slides {background-color="#346bc8"}

1.  Save as pdf: This option only works with `Google Chrome` as explained [here](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf). Or, see below. ![](/posts/pdf.png)

## Sharing slides {background-color="#346bc8"}

2.  Provide the url from the blog/site.

What are the advantages?
