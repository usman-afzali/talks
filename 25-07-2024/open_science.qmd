**What is your perception from the term *"identity"*?**

# How is identity formed socially?

## Identity formation

::: incremental
-   People all over the world believe that their own nation, culture,
    language, and religion are better and more deserving than others.
-   But why?
-   Henri Tajfel (1971)

## Social experiment

::: {.columns align="center" totalwidth="8em"}
::: incremental
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   **Task 1**: Estimate the number of dots on each slide
-   **Outcome**: *"Over-estimators"* and *"under-estimators"*
-   Divided into two random groups
-   **Task 2**: Allocate points to other participants that can be cashed
    for money.

## Findings

::: incremental
-   Allocated **more** points to members of their own group than to
    members of the other group.
-   *Ingroup favouritism* (discrimination)
-   Replicated in many countries
-   `Minimal Groups Paradigm`

## The need for self-esteem

Kassin et al. (2021)

![](figs/selfesteem.png){width="90%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: incremental
-   **Advantage**: Derive pride from our connections
-   **Disadvantage**: The need to belittle *“them”* in order to feel
    secure about *“us”*.
-   Examples: Religious fervor, racial and ethnic conceit, aggressive
    nationalism, and even gossiping [@bosson2006; @weaver2011]
-   When people shared negative attitudes about a third party, they felt
    closer to each other.
:::

## A scenario

::: incremental
-   In New Zealand, as in many other parts of the world, Muslims often
    face stereotypes and prejudices due to their religion, culture, or
    appearance. Islamophobia, or fear and hostility toward Islam and
    Muslims, can be pervasive in society and can manifest in various
    forms, such as discrimination, harassment, or even violence.
-   Now, suppose an individual in New Zealand experiences a threat to
    their self-esteem, such as being criticized by colleagues at work or
    feeling excluded in a social setting. In response to this threat,
    they may seek ways to restore their sense of self-worth or
    superiority. Unfortunately, in some cases, individuals may resort to
    derogating others, including Muslims, as a means of boosting their
    own self-esteem.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: incremental
-   For example, this person might start expressing or endorsing
    negative stereotypes about Muslims, such as portraying them as
    *terrorists*, *backward*, or *incompatible* with Western values. By
    doing so, they may attempt to reaffirm their own *identity* or sense
    of *belonging* within the dominant culture, thus temporarily
    alleviating their feelings of *insecurity* or *inferiority*.
-   By linking the individual's feelings of insecurity or threat in
    social or professional settings to the broader context of
    Islamophobia in New Zealand, we can illustrate how the self-esteem
    maintenance model [@fein1997a] may play out in real-life situations,
    where individuals derogate members of stereotyped groups, such as
    Muslims, to cope with their own insecurities.

**But wait... `When` do we start thinking about identity?**

# Identity development

## Erik Erikson

1902 - 1994. From Wikipedia (The Free Encyclopedia)

![](figs/Erik_Erikson.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Psychosocial theory of human development

::: incremental
-   Stages of development
-   Each stage represents a psychosocial crisis
-   “Human *personality* in principle develops according to steps
    predetermined in the growing person’s readiness to be driven toward,
    to be aware of, and to interact with a widening social radius.” – c.
    1963
:::

## Psychosocial theory of human development

Weiten (2013) ![](figs/stages.png){width="90%"}

## Marcia’s identity statuses

Weiten (2013) ![](figs/marcia.png) Identity achievement is associated
with higher self-esteem, conscientiousness, security, achievement
motivation, and capacity for intimacy [@kroger2006identity].

# Negative consequences

## Identity confusion might lead to

[@côté2018]

:::incremental
-   Anxiety
-   Depression
-   Stress and feeling of being overwhelmed
-   Generally, not a disorder, unless it becomes debilitating
-   For us, it is a bit more complex.
:::

**Have you been in a condition that people don’t believe that you are a
New Zealander?**

# Identity denial

## Identity denial
:::incremental
-   Where are you *really* from?: Asian Americans and identity denial
    [@cheryan2005you]
-   Leads to poor psychological health and wellbeing, such as depressive
    symptoms and stress [@albuja2019identity]
:::
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Do you think our youth have an identity problem?**


# Solutions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: incremental
-   Individually: coping, awareness, standing up, promoting positive
    intergroup contact, building bridges
-   As a group: nurture a strong supportive social network
-   But remember that this should not be exclusive!
:::

## The importance of social support

::: incremental
-   Whoever desires an increase in his sustenance and age, should keep
    good relations with kith and kin. `Sahih Muslim`.
-   Broad. But comes from family, relatives, friends and peers.
-   Social support domains: emotional, instrumental, informational, and
    physical affection. These buffer individuals from stressors.
-   Offering/giving social support is more beneficial than receiving it:
    reduces distress, and improves physical as well as mental health.
-   In married couples, mortality was significantly reduced for those
    who reported providing instrumental support to friends, relatives,
    neighbours, and spouses [@utz2011psychology].
:::

## The importance of family/parenting

::: incremental
-   Married couples have high emotional, psychological, and physical wellbeing
-   Reported being more happy
-   Significantly low levels of depression
-   Children that grow up in a married two parent family are less likely
    to experience emotional-behavioural problems [@brown2004family]
-   They are less likely to drop out of the school, use drugs, give
    birth as teenagers, or experience child abuse
    [@flewelling1990family]
-   More educated and better educational outcomes [@haurin1992patterns].
:::

## What are your thoughts on the following?

:::incremental
-   What brought us together here today?
-   Do we need to look further into Muslim lives, in a more objective way?
-   Are Muslims' happiness, sense of meaning in life, and levels of psychological stress similar to those of people from other religious groups because of the support they get from their religious communities?
-   Will attending mosque more, prevent us from feeling of discrimination?
-   Do we face more challenges to employment and health service than other groups?
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.  Muslims with the strongest ties to their community as measured by
service attendance and prayer are buffered most from anti-Muslim
prejudice.

2.    Muslims experience greater challenges to employment and health than
matched members of other religious groups.

3. Subjective well-being, the meaning of life, and psychological distress
are similar among Muslims and matched members of religious groups from
the buffering of religious community-making.

## Our research into the perception of Muslim community (2016-present)

::: incremental
-   Perception of Muslims in New Zealand
-   National identity
-   Change in attitudes post March 15 attacks
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## My concerns...

::: incremental
-   It does not raise the Muslim voice, because....
-   Muslims are under-represented as `participants` as well as as
    `researchers`.
-   We don't have an objective understanding of Muslim lives in New
    Zealand.

# Muslim Diversity Study (MDS)

## Muslim Diversity Study covers

::: incremental
-   Muslims self-perception, perception of discrimination, diversity,
    flourishing, wellbeing, meaning-making, resilience, life
    satisfaction, and health outcomes.
-   Effects of religion and religious support.
:::

## Aims

::: incremental
-   Increase Muslim community **representation** in research
-   Increase **research opportunities** for the Muslim community
-   **Share findings** back with the community members, leadership, and
    government.
:::

## FAQ's

::: incremental

-   Are my responses confidential?
-   Can my responses be linked back to me?
-   I don't like some of the questions. Is it required to answer all questions?
-   How does it help Muslim community in the long run?
-   How can you participate?
