## Outline

-   Introduction
-   Strengths and weaknesses
-   Design and analysis considerations
-   Types of longitudinal design
-   Applications and examples

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

::: incremental
-   Measuring a variable (or variables) in the same group of subjects over a period of time.
-   Subjects are generally in the same cohort and they age together.
-   It is a within-subjects design (pretest-posttest)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: Measuring IQ at 40, 60, and 80 years of age in the same cohort (or even the same individuals).

## Strengths

::: incremental
-   Estimation of the cohort effect
-   Cohort effect: A cohort effect is when differences in behaviour or traits among people are due to the time period or events they experienced together, rather than their age or other factors. For instance, technology adoption: People born in the 1990s grew up with the internet and are generally more tech-savvy than those born in the 1950s, who had to learn digital skills later in life. The difference in comfort with technology is a cohort effect.
-   Allows studying changes of behaviour in individuals across time

:::

## Weaknesses

::: incremental
-   Time consuming (for researchers and subjects), needs commitment
-   Very expensive
-   High drop-out rates (aka sample/participant attrition), that weakens internal validity (how?)

:::

## Design and Analysis Considerations

::: incremental
-   Representative sampling
-   Minimizing selection bias
-   Choosing appropriate measurement tools
-   Combining quantitative and qualitative approaches
-   Exploring inter-individual and intra-individual differences

## Types of Longitudinal Design

-   Trend studies
-   Cohort studies
-   Panel studies
-   Accelerated longitudinal designs

## Trend Studies

:::incremental
-   Example: Tracking changes in cognitive abilities in a cohort of aging adults.
-   Trend studies, also known as time-trend studies, involve studying changes in a **single variable or phenomenon across different time points**. In trend studies, researchers collect data from different cross-sectional samples at various time intervals. The focus is on observing how the variable of interest changes over time within each sample, without necessarily tracking the same individuals across time.

:::

## Cohort Studies

:::incremental
-   Example: Comparing social attitudes in different generations.
-   Cohort studies involve tracking **specific groups (cohorts)** of individuals over time. Cohorts are usually defined by a shared characteristic, such as birth year or life experience. Researchers collect data from the same group of individuals at multiple time points to study changes and developments within that specific cohort. This design allows for the examination of cohort-specific effects and trends.

:::

## Panel Studies

:::incremental
-   Example: Tracking academic performance in a group of students from childhood to adulthood
-   Panel studies involve collecting data from the **same individuals** (the panel) at multiple time points. The goal is to track individual trajectories and changes over time. Panel studies require the same participants to be measured on the same variables repeatedly, making them well-suited for examining within-person variability and changes within specific individuals over time.

:::

## Accelerated Longitudinal Design

:::incremental
-   Example: Studying language acquisition in children over a few months
-   Accelerated longitudinal designs involve **intensive data collection over a shorter period** compared to traditional longitudinal studies. This design is particularly useful when researchers are interested in studying rapid changes or development within a relatively compressed time-frame. Accelerated designs can involve repeated measurements over weeks or months, capturing significant changes in a short span.

:::


## Key Differences

::: incremental
1.    **Focus and Purpose**: Trend studies focus on tracking changes in a single variable across different samples over time, while cohort studies focus on specific birth cohorts or groups, panel studies track the same individuals, and accelerated designs focus on capturing rapid changes.

2.    **Sampling**: Trend studies involve different cross-sectional samples at each time point, cohort studies follow specific groups, panel studies involve the same individuals, and accelerated designs may involve a focused sample over a short period.

:::

## Key Differences

::: incremental
3.    **Data collection**: Trend studies collect data from different samples at different times, cohort studies collect data from the same cohort over time, panel studies repeatedly measure the same individuals, and accelerated designs gather intensive data in a shorter duration.


4.    **Research questions**: Trend studies are good for examining overall trends, cohort studies are useful for cohort-specific effects, panel studies can explore within-person changes, and accelerated designs capture rapid changes or developments.

:::

## Key Differences

5.    **Benefits and challenges**: Trend studies can identify overall patterns but may suffer from cohort effects; cohort studies provide cohort-specific insights but require long-term commitment; panel studies allow for individual-level analysis but can be resource-intensive; accelerated designs capture rapid changes but may not capture long-term effects.


## Applications of Longitudinal Studies

::: incremental
-   **Developmental psychology**
-   Examining cognitive, social, and emotional development
-   Identifying risk and protective factors for developmental outcomes 
-   **Clinical psychology** 
-   Tracking treatment effectiveness and relapse prevention 
-   Understanding trajectories of mental health disorders
-   **Social psychology**
-   Tracking changes in values, attitudes and behaviours

## Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study

This study has followed a cohort of 1,037 individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1972-1973. Participants have been assessed at various ages to understand the development of physical health, mental health, and social behavior over their lives. The study has provided insights into the development of mental disorders, addiction, and antisocial behavior.

## The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS)
![](~/Documents/GitHub/talks/figs/mds-sponsors.png)

----------

The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) is a longitudinal quantitative panel research project that began in 2009 by Prof Chris Sibley (The University of Auckland). It focuses on investigating the attitudes, values, and beliefs of New Zealanders over time. The study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how various factors, including demographics, experiences, and historical context, shape individuals' opinions and behaviours.

## NZAVS Features

::: incremental
-   **Longitudinal Nature:** The NZAVS follows a large and diverse sample of New Zealanders across different age groups over an extended period. This longitudinal design enables researchers to track changes in attitudes and values across generations and identify trends and shifts over time.
-   **Wide Range of Topics:** The study covers a broad range of topics, including social, political, environmental, and cultural attitudes. It delves into issues such as discrimination, social cohesion, well-being, environmental concerns, political participation, and national identity.
-   **Data Collection Methods:** The NZAVS collects data through online or printed surveys. The surveys include both established measures and new items designed to capture emerging issues and trends.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: incremental

-   **Public Engagement:** The study emphasizes public engagement and transparency. Researchers share findings with the public and policymakers, contributing to informed discussions and evidence-based decision-making.
-   **Treatment:** Treatments can happen – but mostly in the form of natural or man-made events (e.g., changes in the government, some government policies/legislations, Covid-19, earthquakes, floods, massacres).
